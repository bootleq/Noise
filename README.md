WebExtension Compatibility
--------------------------

Compatible version is under development at `webext` branch.

Please understand that most functionalities will become unavailable.

Noise still aims to provide a place to manage many events and sounds, while
WebExtension has relatively more limitation, we can only gradually add new
function step by step.


Legacy Version (Firefox &lt; v57)
---------------------------------

Please use Noise v1.4.3.
